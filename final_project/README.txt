Save input dataset X into data_train.npy and desired output vector Y into labels_train.npy
Make sure data_train.npy and labels_train.npy are in the same directory

Just run the train.py file. This file will save the model in a .h5 format.

For the test.py file, 
Save the test input data and output data into data_train.npy and labels_train.npy
Replace 'data_train.npy' with 'data_test.npy' and 'labels_train.npy' with 'labels_test.npy'

Then run the test.py file
